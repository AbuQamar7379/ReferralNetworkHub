# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers of **ReferralNetworkHub**, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and supportive community that empowers professionals to connect, refer candidates, and advance careers through our job referral platform.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility, apologizing for mistakes, and learning from experiences.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community over individual interests.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances.
- Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without explicit permission.
- Conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The **ReferralNetworkHub** maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They have the authority to remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., comments, commits, issues) that violate this Code of Conduct and will communicate moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all **ReferralNetworkHub** community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions).
- Email communications (e.g., rutikkulkarni2001@gmail.com).
- Future platforms (e.g., Discord, Slack, or forums, if implemented).

It also applies when individuals represent the project publicly, such as via official email, social media, or events.

## Enforcement

To report abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior, contact the maintainer at [rutikkulkarni2001@gmail.com](mailto:rutikkulkarni2001@gmail.com). Reports can be anonymous, and we aim to review and respond within 48 hours. All complaints will be investigated promptly, fairly, and confidentially.
